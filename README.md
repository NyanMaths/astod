# Welcome to A Stupid Tower Defense repo !

It is a rather barebones tower defense game for a uni project.

## Features

You can launch the game and play until victory over the scenario you chose.
The gameplay consists in putting towers on the buildable areas and trying to survive through all levels.

Open a shell in the repo's root.
